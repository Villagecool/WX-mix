The Event for smooth transitions, so I don't
have to redo the flash effect everytime

Value 1 makes the flash behave differently
"0"	- Nothing (At the start, so it's loaded but doesn't disturb)
"1"	- Short Stay, Medium Decay  
"2"	- Long Stay, Long Decay
"3"  	- Short Stay, Long Decay
"Dark" - Bendy's transition
